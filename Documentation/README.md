# SwiftGen documentation

This directory contains documentation for various topics of SwiftGen

## General Documentation

* Documentation of [the `swiftgen.yml` Configuration File's format](ConfigFile.md)
* Migrating from an old version of SwiftGen? Check our [Migration Guide](MigrationGuide.md)

## [Articles on specific SwiftGen topics](Articles/)

#### Integrating SwiftGen with other tooling

* [Integrate SwiftGen in your Xcode projects as a Script Build Phase](Articles/Xcode-Integration.md)
* [Use SwiftLint to generate warnings about code not using SwiftGen-generated constants](Articles/SwiftLint-Integration.md)
* An alternative way to [integrate SwiftGen on your CI](Articles/Making-CI-check-SwiftGen-changes.md)

#### Creating your own templates

* Learn how to [create your own custom templates](Articles/Creating-custom-templates.md) to customize the code SwiftGen generates
* Iterate quickly when creating custom templates by [watching a file or folder for changes](Articles/Watch-a-folder-for-changes.md)

## [Templates Documentation](templates/)

SwiftGen comes with built-in templates. Each parser (Assets Catalog parser, Strings parser, etc) comes with one or more built-in templates adapted to the type of input resources that parser will parse. Each template can also accept parameters (`params` key in your `swiftgen.yml` config file) to adjust the generated code sligthly.

The documentation for each template, their intended use, and their supported parameters can be found in [Documentation/templates/](templates/)

## [Parsers Documentation](Parsers/)

SwiftGen uses parsers to parse different type of input files, like asset catalogs, strings files, font files, etc.

You can find the documentation for each parser in [Documentation/Parsers/](Parsers/), describing the type of input file each parser supports, as well as the default filter they use and potential options that can be configured for that parser.

## [Contexts Documentation](SwiftGenKit Contexts)

The way SwiftGen works is to parse your input files (resources like Asset Catalogs, Strings files, etc) using those parsers described above, and transform them into a structured dictionary – that we call SwiftGenKit Contexts – representing the parsed data.

That parsed data ("context") is then fed to our template engine (Stencil) alongside a template, to finally produce the generated code.

If you are writing your own templates, you will need to read the [documentation about those SwiftGenKit Contexts](SwiftGenKit Contexts) to understand the variables that are exposed and available in those contexts.

Contexts are basically structured dictionaries and the documentation of contexts generated by each parser will tell you the structure and keys of those dictionaries that you can then use in your templates to use the parsed data.
